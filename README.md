jasmine-sinon-railsbk
=====================

I am taking jasmine-sinon matchers from https://github.com/froots/jasmine-sinon for the Rails 3.1+ asset pipeline and modifying it so I can use it with the latest version of sinon. I will get a PR out for the main on but I need this to work.

Installation
============

1. Add ```gem 'jasmine-sinon-railsbk'``` to your gemfile
2. Run bundle install
3. Add ```#= require jasmine-sinon``` to your spec manifest
